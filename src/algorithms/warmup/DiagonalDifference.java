/*
 * ========== Diagonal Difference ==========
 * 
 * Given a square matrix of size N x N, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.
 * 
 * Input:
 * The first line contains a single integer, N. The next N lines denote the matrix's rows,
 * with each line containing N space-separated integers describing the columns.
 * 
 * Output:
 * Print the absolute difference between the two sums of the matrix's diagonals as a single integer.
